Demographics Analysis of Indian States

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes demographic statistics of 10 Indian states, focusing on population, literacy rate, and rural population percentage. The analysis provides insights into how rural population affects literacy rates and overall demographics.

📊 Data Used

The dataset consists of fictional demographic data for 10 Indian states with the following attributes:

State: Name of the state

Population: Total population of the state

Literacy Rate (%): Literacy rate of the state

Rural Population Percentage (%): Percentage of people living in rural areas

🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used

Python 🐍

Pandas 📊 (for data manipulation & analysis)

Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨 (for data visualization)

🚀 Key Findings

Total Population of Listed States: Computed by summing up the population of all 10 states.

Average Literacy Rate: Mean literacy rate across all states.

Correlation Analysis: Explores the relationship between literacy rate and rural population percentage.

📈 Visualizations
